            Anna here!
        </h2>
        <p class="p"> Staying curious in my studies has allowed me to develop an individualized skillset.
            Collaborating with you would allow me to grow further in my craft.</p>
        <p class="p">The goal of my portfolio is to promote my approachability. I love talking professionally with others, especially making good ties with those I am going to work with. I anticipate doing some freelance work at some point in my career, and it would be great to step into that space with a portfolio I built on my own. I find a lot of independence by researching techniques in Photoshop, using LinkedIn Learning to learn formatting languages, and I want this to come across through my digital presence. I want to keep the door open with animation-related opportunities, and I think I will pursue a website that is graphics-heavy. The goal is to use this digital portfolio to apply for internships or freelance work, showing I am capable of building a web page that is coordinated, professional, and always with the client in mind. I want to showcase my past work to an extent, but put an emphasis on how I will continue to work in the future.</p>
