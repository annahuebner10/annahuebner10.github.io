    <h3>A Little More About Me:</h3>

    <p>My name is Anna, and I'm finishing my senior year at Mizzou in Columbia, Missouri. I will graduate in May 2023 with a Bachelorâ€™s of Fine Arts, majoring in Digital Storytelling and minoring in Business. I specialize in Animation, working in both 2D and 3D. Getting a Digital Storytelling degree has taught me great creative lessons, most of which come from my time living at the <em>Evans Scholarship</em> house<br>
    <p> I went to high school at Lutheran South in Affton, Missouri. I participated in a variety of activities, including varsity golf & swim, jazz band, and yearbook club. Going to Mizzou for college, I've participated in the Evans Scholarship, working on a video project with IMSD, and formatting newsletter articles with the Association of Medical Illustrators.</p>
    <p>Working as a golf caddie in high school, I went on to earn a full-tuition and housing scholarship to pursue my creative career at the University of Missouri. I continue to reinvest in my scholarship by mentoring younger caddie candidates and working as our Vice President of Communications. I love thrift shopping with my sisters and finding new trails to explore - Columbia is <strong>great</strong> for that!</p>
