    Good day, my name is Anna, and I'm starting my senior year here at Mizzou. I can't believe it is the first of the lasts! That's ok, because I know college is a special time in my life. College has taught me great lessons. I look forward to beginning my career. Working with some user interface and graphics would be the best. A little more about me, I love movies and have so many to watch. I relax by reading on my Kindle with a cup of hot chocolate. I try to draw, but since it is not a habit of mine, I often forget to. This is one place I want to grow in. More so, I just returned from my semester abroad! It is nice coming back to Columbia. This semester is extra special to me. I am thankful for all the classes and friends I get to catch up with.
