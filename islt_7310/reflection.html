        <p><B>E</B>arning my degree at Mizzou has been truly filling. I do not see it as an extension of my previous education; rather, it has been a platform that I continue to jump from. I am most surprised by the integration of all areas of study, from sciences to technological focuses, societal discussions and artist statements. My instructors are encouraged to see a purpose brought to their classes.</p>

        <p><b>M</b>y drive to learn increased through the COVID-19 pandemic. I was thankful for the tools, software and resources I could access from my house. Upon returning, it was obvious how much more value I saw from my campus & the young people I live with. There was a potential I hadn’t considered: my curiosity to learn kept me from quitting.</p>
        
       <p><b>I</b> created my first 3D animated short entirely from my house. I became a remote virtual assistant for a food blogger in Virginia. I completed course after course on LinkedIn Learning. These items stemmed from my curiosity and independence - How do I round the edges of this 3D object? What layouts and color schemes are interesting to my target audience? Where do my design talents best reflect in a practical setting? </p> 
        
        <p><b>I</b>t became obvious that I am more than just a set of hands in a pipeline. My curiosity reminds me of that encouragement I’ve seen through my instructors here at Mizzou. In the classroom, behind a Zoom call, or working independently, I know that my abilities are refined because I continue to ask questions & seek out answers. I have been hesitant to dive into learning script languages, but joining the Association of Medical Illustrators is the next platform I’m jumping into. I format monthly newsletter articles with other Medical Illustrators, using lots of HTML/CSS language. Formatting for the web/mobile is entirely interesting; its universal accessibility, with the design aspects of aesthetic, makes me confident that I want to start my career in User Interface. </p>
        
       <P><b>N</b>avigating my Digital Storytelling degree after graduation is daunting. However, I know that my curiosity has opened many doors for me, even in these short 4 years. I am looking forward to continuing working remotely, as I find that it pushes me to create at my best. I want to build interfaces that others will not feel overwhelmed by. I want to bring my animation talents to the table, through icons and interactions on various internet access points. I am encouraged by my advisors, instructors, and peers to dive in and learn so that I may grow further.</P>
