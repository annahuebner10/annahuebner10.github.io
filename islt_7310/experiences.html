        <p class="main p">I have had a variety of experiences since starting my time at university. Here is a short summary of my most notable.</p>

        <img class="experience_image" src="local files/fry.png"/>
        
        <p class="p">First, I started as a golf caddie in high school. After talking with members at my country club, I knew I had a chance at applying for the Chick Evans Scholarship, a full tuition and housing opportunity at Mizzou. I had to caddie over 100 times in 2 years to be eligible to apply. Instead of tossing in the towel, I decided to try for the scholarship! I knew it would be a steep climb, and not many people would understand the sacrifice I was about to make. I had severeal conversations with my teachers, members from my club, and especially with my family. After a thorough review of my application, I was considered for an interview and earned my scholarship. To this day, it has been my greatest achievement. I know the opportunities that are held within this title are unmatched, and I love that I channeled my passion for golf into a summer position.</p>

        <p class="p">Second, I created my first 3D animated short entirely from my house. After our COVID shutdown came unexpectedly in 2020, I had a minimal exposure to the Autodesk Maya software. Knowing I wanted to work in animation and visualization, I knew the odds were stacked against me in a remote setting. However, I diligently emailed my animation instructor question after question, and taught myself the program just through my trial and error. I have found that this is also the best way to learn HTML/CSS formatting, because you often can't jump the gun and get the same result you see in your head. I finished my first animated short, 'Clay Mate,' and took home the pride of teaching myself an advanced, industry-standard software in animation.</p>

        <p class="p">Third, I studied abroad. After our COVID regulations eased up a bit, I knew I had fewer opportunities to see the world. Especially in college, and as a young person, I knew going abroad would be formative to me. I was the only individual from Mizzou to attend my school, and it was the first time I had left the United States. I was really encouraged to try traveling on my own, experience taking myself out for dinner, and even just living in my town in Norwich. I pushed myself to try new things, like jumping in cold lakes with my friend Ida (she is from Sweden). I also understood how many people speak other languages, and how important that exposure is to continue in my day-to-day. I am so thankful for the 5 months I spent in Europe; they made me realize what our world can look like, outside of the classroom.</p>

        <p class="p">Finally, I work as the Communications representative for the Missouri Evans Scholars. My classmate Destiny had this position prior to myself. We have grown close because of it; also, Destiny is just a cool person in general. Currently I design the merchandise for our scholarship chapter. I take photos of all the scholars living in our house, enjoying our awesome and unique opportunity to grow together. I get to lead with our executive board, making decisions with our whole house in mind. I write newsletter articles and push them out to our parents and directors. This position reminds me of what I have been blessed with, and what I can contribute back into those around me.</P>
